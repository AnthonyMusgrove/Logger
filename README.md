# Installation

## NuGet


```bash
dotnet add package labworx.logger 
```

or

```powershell
Install-Package labworx.logger
```

---

# Quick Start

```csharp
using Labworx;

var logger = new Logger(logName, LogOptions);

logger.WriteLine("Application Started");
logger.WriteLine("Loading configuration...");
logger.WriteLine("Finished.");
```

---

# Configuration

Logger can be configured using the `LoggerOptions` class.

```csharp
String logName = "MyAppLogins";

var options = new LoggerOptions
{
    autoRoute = true,
    RotationInterval = LoggerRotationInterval.Daily,
    RotateOnFileSizeLimit = "25MB",
    TotalFilesToRetain = 30,
    TimeStampFormat = LoggerTimestampFormat.DateTime24HrFormatSQL
};

var logger = new Logger(logName, options);
```

---

# LoggerOptions

| Property | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `autoRoute` | Automatically selects the best log location on the system. |
| `CustomPath` | Specify your own directory for log files. |
| `CustomExtension` | Change the default `.log` extension. |
| `RotateOnFileSizeLimit` | Rotate when a file reaches a specified size (e.g. `10MB`, `500KB`, `2GB`). |
| `RotationInterval` | Time-based log rotation interval. |
| `TotalFilesToRetain` | Maximum number of log files to retain. `0` = Unlimited. |
| `TimeStampFormat` | Select one of the built-in timestamp formats. |
| `CustomTimestampFormat` | Custom .NET DateTime format string when using `Custom`. |

---

# Rotation Intervals

Logger supports automatic time-based rotation.

| Interval | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Disabled | No time-based rotation |
| Minutely | New log every minute |
| Hourly | New log every hour |
| Daily | New log every day |
| Weekly | New log every week |
| Fortnightly | New log every two weeks |
| Monthly | New log every month |
| Yearly | New log every year |

---

# File Size Rotation

Logger can automatically create a new log file when a file reaches a specified size.

Examples:

```text
500B
100KB
5MB
250MB
2GB
```

Size-based rotation works alongside time-based rotation.

---

# File Retention

Prevent log folders from growing indefinitely.

```csharp
TotalFilesToRetain = 20;
```

Once the configured limit is reached:

- Oldest log files are automatically deleted
- New log files continue to be created
- Rotation continues seamlessly

Set to:

```csharp
0
```

for unlimited retention.

---

# Timestamp Formats

Logger includes numerous built-in timestamp formats.

Examples include:

| Format | Example |
|---------|---------|
| SQL 24 Hour | `2026-07-05 19:42:18` |
| ISO 8601 | `2026-07-05T19:42:18.123+10:00` |
| International | `05 Jul 2026 19:42:18` |
| File Safe | `260705_194218` |
| Date Only | `05-07-2026` |
| Time Only | `19:42:18` |
| 12 Hour | `05/07/2026 07:42 PM` |
| Custom | Any .NET DateTime format |

Example:

```csharp
var options = new LoggerOptions
{
    TimeStampFormat = LoggerTimestampFormat.Custom,
    CustomTimestampFormat = "dddd dd MMMM yyyy HH:mm:ss"
};
```

---

# Automatic Log Routing

When `autoRoute` is enabled, Logger automatically selects an appropriate writable location on the operating system.

If a custom path is supplied, Logger will automatically use that location instead.

```csharp
autoRoute = true;
```

or

```csharp
CustomPath = @"C:\Logs";
```

## AutoRoute Paths

| Operating System | Path |
|---------|---------|
| Windows (Standalone/Console) | `:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\AppName\Logs` |
| Windows (Service) | `:\ProgramData\AppName\Logs` |
| Linux/nix | `/home/<user>/AppName/Logs` |
| Mac OSX | `Users/username/Library/Application Support/AppName/Logs` |
| Android | `/data/user/0/[your.package.name]/files/logs` |
| Fallback | `?UserProfile?/AppName/Logs` |
| Unsupported | If Fallback fails to yield a value, an exception is thrown |

---

# Example Configuration

```csharp
var options = new LoggerOptions(
    autoRoute: true,
    RotationInterval: LoggerRotationInterval.Daily,
    TotalFilesToRetain: 14,
    RotateOnFileSizeLimit: "50MB",
    TimeStampFormat: LoggerTimestampFormat.ISO8601TZOffset
);

var logger = new Logger(options);
```
